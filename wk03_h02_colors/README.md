# Homework Week 3: 

1. Make an expressive transition between colors. Think of a particular emotion. What color seems most representative of it? How does it appear? How does it fade away? Think of another emotion and the matching color for it. Change the beginning and ending color of the above code to match those emotions. Then animate the transition using shaping functions. Robert Penner developed a series of popular shaping functions for computer animation known as easing functions, you can use this example as research and inspiration but the best result will come from making your own transitions.

2. Compose a gradient that resembles a William Turner sunset

6. Watch the following works of Leo Villareal and for each one make a shaders that looks like it:

7. If you look closely at the color wheel used on color pickers (see http://patriciogonzalezvivo.com/2015/thebookofshaders/06/), they use a different spectrum according to RYB color space. For example, the opposite color of red should be green, but in our example it is cyan. Can you find a way to fix that in order to look exactly like the following image?

8. Modify the polar example to get a spinning color wheel, just like the waiting mouse icon.

9. Use a shaping function together with the conversion function from HSB to RGB to expand a particular hue value and shrink the rest.
